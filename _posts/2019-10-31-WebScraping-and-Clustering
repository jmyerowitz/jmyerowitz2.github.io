title: "Clustering Similar New Hampshire Trails via WebScraping"

Recently, my Master's program (UNH Analytics and Data Science, represent!) had a small module on webscraping using R via Rvest and Selenium. I looked at a website called [alltrails.com](https://www.alltrails.com). It's a really handy site for information on trails all around the world. I've only used it locally for New England trails, but I've seen trails in Spain pop up as well.

I'm an avid hiker. I'm originally from Maine, so I wanted to get a feel for the different trails in New Hampshire. New Hampshire has trails that range from a nice stroll to a strenuous hike up Mt. Washington. I had the thought that it would be cool to pick new trails based off the characteristics of previous trails that I had hiked--sounds like a good opportunity to cluster!
